First Assignment - By: Zayan Kibria
Hi, my name is Zayan Kibria. I am a current freshman at City Tech. Growing up, I always had a strong curiosity towards computers and coding. I was always fascinated by how such a powerful machine came to be. I am taking this course because it fits in with my major, cybersecurity. In this course, I hope to learn the basics of coding, how it would help me in the real world, but mainly, how modern software works together with modern hardware in our ever-changing digital world. Furthermore, I read about Mr. Barreda online and saw 1) his rating and reviews on Rate My Professor, and 2) was impressed by the plethora of skills and experience he had relating to computers and programming. One fun fact about me is that I love to explore new technology and gadgets. When we moved into our new house, I "smartified" my house, changing whatever I could "smartify" to make my life more convenient. For example, every light switch and light bulb was changed to a smarter counterpart, and the same goes for fire alarms, doorbells, security systems, etc. Whatever I could find at Best Buy and buy with my membership card, I bought. In fact, in order to help pay off my college tuition, I applied for a job at Best Buy when I was 17, but was unfortunately rejected.
